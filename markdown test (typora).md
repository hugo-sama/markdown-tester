## image and link insert

All images inserted may rendered differently between Typora and GitHub. You can make the `Auto escape image URL when insert` option checked to transfer all the space in path to `%20`, so images and links with space works properly on GitHub. 

before:

[link with space](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/) 

![image with space](assets/500px Octicons mark github svg.png)

after:

[link with space](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/)
